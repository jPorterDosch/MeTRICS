"""Enums for the streamvggt dataset pipeline.

Kept in a dependency-free leaf module so both the dataset loaders and the
config can import them without a cycle. Members subclass ``(str, enum.Enum)``
so a plain string from a CLI / YAML / test coerces to a member via
``Split(value)``, matching the house style in
``streamvggt.depth_cond.config``.
